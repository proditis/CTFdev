# CTFdev

The following is a collection of information, advises and tips for CTF organizers, developers and content creators.&#x20;

This is not intended for as a CTF player field guide,there are some excellent resources on the subject.

If you ever wanted to organize and conduct a CTF or you want to learn how to create challenges and target machines this is going to help you.

## Who?

I am one of the main developers of [https://echoCTF.RED](https://echoctf.red/) a platform that was designed from the ground up to conduct capture the flag competitions and and cyber-security events.

We have been using this platform for the past 10 years to conduct some of the most spectacular capture the flag competitions.&#x20;

This book will try to encapsulate this knowledge of the past 10 years in a way that will be easily understood.

## Why?

Why do such a guide you may ask? Why not? :smile:

* It seems that every month I will get a bunch of DM's on our Discord from people who want to do their own CTF or create challenges or sponsor a CTF, but they dont know where to start.&#x20;
* There seems to be an endless number of guides for CTF participants, but almost none for those who want to organize, conduct or develop CTF's.
* I wanted to share my experiences with those looking to embark into this adventure and hopefully save them some pain and suffering down the road.
