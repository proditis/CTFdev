This document outlines the creative process and thinking that goes behind the scenes in the development of unique and interesting scenarios.

One of the questions that people ask, is how do we find such unique ideas for the targets we create and if we know of any guides or tutorials to point them to that help them in learning how to make targets and challenges.

The uninitiated will think `How hard can it be? i mean it took me 10 minutes to solve this challenge... Surely i can make one better`...

Well i don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but get ready to be tortured. Failed builds, bugs in logic and a lot more awaits you.

But I am not here to scare you, I am here to help you get over some of the difficulties or at least be better prepared for them. This is based on some of the things i've learned in developing and delivering CTFs and cybersecurity exercises for the past 10 years.
