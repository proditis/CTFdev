# Organizers

### Plan ahead for some failures

A CTF is like any other live performance, things can and will go wrong. A good organizer knows and expects that and is ready with fallback plans.

As an organizer be ready for some things to go unexpectedly werong, from the smallest to the biggest of issues.

### It is not about you, it is for the participants to enjoy

One of the things we usually say to the organizers we work with is:

> **Our main obligations are first and foremost towards the players and secondary to any other needs of the event**

The main reason for that is that if the players are satisfied and enjoy their time, then any potential message or scope of the event will also have better chances to be received.

### Players are always right, even when they're not

Many times you will receive complaints from players that have an issue and who feel that since you are the organizer you will have some better effect on the team conducting the CTF.

Even though things may sound greek to you, try to pay attention at what they're saying. Often times they just want to vend off some of the frustration. Having someone to listen to their issue help to ease them out.

Dont dismiss them and dont side with them (unless there is a clear indication of misconducting from the CTF conducting team).

### Give enough time

Give plenty of time for the CTF to be developed. Don't wait until the last week. I know it sounds simple to many, but its not.&#x20;

Designing and developing quality challenges that can be enjoyed by everyone that will participate takes time.&#x20;

If you only give a small amount of time to the team that will do development for you then be ready for some copy/paste challenges.
