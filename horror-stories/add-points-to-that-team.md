# Add points to that team

So at one huge universities CTF that took place at a national level, we had the most strange request yet...

The company that hired us, wanted us to add points to one of the teams so that they get better standings on the leader-board.

So this customer went behind our team leaders back, and tried to "bully" the newer members of our team to do it. However, this is something that we NEVER EVER EVER DO and everyone knows this because we have communicated it clearly with the entire team (its even in our contracts)...

I wont go deep into what happened here since it still kind of pains me and i have no proof in my hands other than my word. Lets just say someone lost a position from the leader-board and someone gained, even though it was for the "better" good of the entire nation... :man\_shrugging:

### Moral of the story

* Be prepared for some stupid requests...
* Communicate your rules and requirements clearly with your team. Give them the authority on such subjects to be autonomous.
* Don't ever ever EVER alter the scores, make sure you communicate this with organizers and sponsors.
