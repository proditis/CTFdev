# From Who?

I am one of the main developers of [https://echoCTF.RED](https://echoctf.red/) a platform that was designed from the ground up to conduct capture the flag competitions and and cyber-security events.

We have been using this platform for the past 10 years to conduct some of the most spectacular capture the flag competitions.&#x20;

This book will try to encapsulate this knowledge of the past 10 years in a way that will be easily understood.

This does not mean that I am an authority on the subject, it just means i've seen a lot instances.
