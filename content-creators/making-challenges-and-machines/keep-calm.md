# 🤬Keep calm

There are a few things that you have to be prepared for as a challenge creator that nobody prepares you for.

As a challenge creator get'll get

1. People are going to steal your shit with 0 fucks given and some times almost verbatim
2. People are going to accuse you of stealing their challenge, (eg a challenge you made got copied by a big CTF so the majority of people saw it there first...)
3. People are going to give credit to the person who copied it from you...
4. People thinking that you suck 🐒⚽⚽ because they solved your challenge (yes there are those)
5. People who are going to make you feel like they are asking you back their time **`spend`** playing your challenge

## Not so obvious

So why keep calm if all those 💩 goes around? The answer is simple, you don't do it for the shitheads, you're doing it for the rest of the players who did enjoy and appreciate your job 😂

No matter how bad the criticism, the majority of players will always enjoy and appreciate your efforts and this will be visible at the end of your CTF. Take bad criticism as an opportunity to improve your challenges in the future.

I much rather spend my time to make my challenges shithead-proof than hacking-proof...
