# Forget the BETA notion

Every... Single... Developer (including this author) that i've seen assume that beta versions tend to have better "treatment" or that players will treat them differently... Nothing could be further from the truth... The moment the first player joins your platform, your project becomes production, the _BETA_ notion is now only in your head.

People will expect everything they see to be fully functional, nobody cares that _you're testing._ Be ready to receive reports about anything and everything. There is no more temporary fixes or immunity from security incidents...
