# Organizers

So you've decided to organize a CTF and you have no idea where to start, here are a few things that you'll need to decide sooner rather than later:

* is this going to be an online or onsite event?
* when and where is it going to take place
* how many participants do you expect? make a rough estimate or upper and lower bounds
* how and when are the participants going to register?
* are there going to be prizes for the participants and what are those going to be
* are there going to be sponsors and if so, what are your expectations from them?
* are there going to be presentations during your event? if so what subjects?
* who is responsible for what? who's speaking with the sponsors, who's dealing with player questions, who's going to provide support during the event?
* what is the end goal for the CTF? have fun? advertise a service? promote a conference? discover talent?
* what is the intended and expected participant experience level?
